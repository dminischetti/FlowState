# UI Refresh Summary

## Design Tokens
- Introduced a cohesive theme system built on shared CSS variables (`--bg-primary`, `--bg-secondary`, `--text-primary`, `--text-secondary`, `--accent`, `--border-color`, `--radius`, `--transition`) for consistent styling across components.
- Added semantic support colors for feedback (`--accent-soft`, `--danger`, `--success`) and motion tokens (`--focus-ring`) to keep interactions gentle yet clear.

## Color Palette
- **Dark theme:** charcoal foundations (#1e1e1e / #2a2a2a) with misted surfaces and cyan accents (#7dd3fc, #38bdf8).
- **Light theme:** soft grey canvas (#f5f6f8) with white surfaces and crisp blue accents (#0ea5e9, #0284c7) to maintain WCAG-friendly contrast.

## Key Enhancements
- Rebuilt layout spacing and rhythm for a calm three-column workspace that collapses elegantly on smaller screens.
- Softened all components with borderless cards, seamless inputs, and focus-visible outlines for accessible navigation.
- Added theme toggles and persistence, plus smoother motion and reduced-chrome surfaces for a focused, modern workspace and authentication flow.
